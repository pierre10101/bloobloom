# Dev test for Bloobloom

## Instructions

- `npm run install`
- `npm run dev`

## Note 

- I initially implemented the ui as per the site and later read that it was the wrong UI. 
- Only after finishing did I read at the end that implementing the existing UI gives bonus points
- I left remnants of the live site ui in the codebase. 

## Architecture

- Tried following BEM but departed
- Used no Sass as my assumption was that only CSS should be used. 
- Loosely used Nuxt folder structure.
